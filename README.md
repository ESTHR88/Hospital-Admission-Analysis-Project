# Hospital-Admission-Analysis-Project
“This project contains SQL queries and isights for hospital admission dataset analysis”

## Project Overview
This is a beginner-level SQL project that demonstrates basic data analysis on a hospital admissions dataset. The project includes SQL queries to uncover trends in patient demographics, disease conditions and outcomes. The goal of this project is to build a foundation in SQL-based data analysis while connecting results to real-world healthcare decision-making.

## Features / Queries
1.Total Admissions – Counts all patient admissions to understand dataset size.
2.Admission Types – Compares Emergency vs OPD admissions.
3.Monthly Trends – Shows admission patterns over time (month_year).
4.Gender Distribution – Identifies male vs female admission ratios.
5.Average Duration of Stay – Calculates average hospital stay per month.
6.Critical Conditions – Analyzes prevalence of STEMI, Heart Failure, and ACS.
7.Outcomes by Condition – Tracks recovery, expiry, and DAMA for heart failure patients.
8.Comorbidity Analysis – Identifies patients with multiple risk factors (DM, HTN, CAD).
9.STEMI Trends – Observes prevalence changes of STEMI admissions across months.

## Dataset
1.The project uses a hospital admissions dataset from Kaggle.
2.The project uses the CSV file `hospital_admissions.csv` provided in this repository.


## How to Use
1. Open your SQL environment (e.g., SQL Server Management Studio).  
2. Create a new database and tables (or use the provided SQL scripts).  
3. Run the SQL scripts in order to generate reports and insights.  

## Learning Outcomes
1. Understanding basic SQL queries (`SELECT`, `COUNT`, `GROUP BY`, `DISTINCT`).  
2. Practicing data analysis on real-world healthcare datasets.  
3. Preparing a project for GitHub portfolio.

**Analysis & Insights**
1. Provided the total number of hospital admissions in the dataset.
2. Helped identify the proportion of urgent vs scheduled cases.
3. Showed seasonal/monthly fluctuations in patient inflow, useful for capacity planning.
4. Highlighted male vs female patient distribution, important for demographic profiling.
5. Helped track whether hospital stay length was stable or increasing, useful for resource allocation.
6. Quantified burden of severe cardiovascular conditions among patients.
7. Gave a mortality vs recovery snapshot for high-risk patients.
8. Showed hospital-level discharge vs mortality performance.
9. Identified high-risk multimorbidity cases and completely healthy admissions.
10.Helped assess whether STEMI admissions were increasing, stable, or declining.

**Key Findings**

1.Emergency admissions dominated over OPD in this dataset.
2.Gender split showed (9990 and 5767  male > female).
3.Average hospital stay was around (6,7days) stable across months.
4.A significant proportion of patients had serious cardiac conditions (STEMI, Heart Failure, ACS).
5.Multimorbidity burden was evident, with several patients having DM, HTN, and CAD together.
6.Heart Failure outcomes revealed that while most patients were discharged, there were still cases of expiry and DAMA.

**Conclusion & Impact**

This project shows SQL analysis but generates actionable healthcare insights: Hospital administrators might use admission trends for staffing and resource allocation. Clinical teams also can monitor disease burden and patient outcomes to improve care protocols.
Moreover,Policy makers can assess impact of comorbidities and design better intervention programs.

 The impact demonstrates the ability to connect data results with healthcare decision-making impact.

I am building foundation to move towards  advanced data projects.
