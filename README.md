# Hospital-Admission-Analysis-Project
“This project contains SQL queries for hospital admission dataset analysis”

## Project Overview
This is a beginner-level SQL project that demonstrates basic data analysis on a hospital admissions dataset. The project includes SQL queries to uncover trends in patient demographics, disease conditions and outcomes by calculate total admissions, analyze gender distribution, and explore the type of admissions.

## Features / Queries
- **Total Admissions**: Counts the total number of patient admissions.
- **Gender Distribution**: Shows the number of male and female patients.
- **Type of Admission**: Displays different admission types (e.g., Emergency, OPD).

## Dataset
- The project uses a hospital admissions dataset from Kaggle.
- The project uses the CSV file `hospital_admissions.csv` provided in this repository.
- The dataset contains basic patient information including `MRD_NO`, `Date_of_Admission`, `Date_of_Discharge`, `Age`, `Gender`, and `Type_of_Admission`.

## How to Use
1. Open your SQL environment (e.g., SQL Server Management Studio).  
2. Create a new database and tables (or use the provided SQL scripts).  
3. Run the SQL scripts in order to generate reports and insights.  

## Learning Outcomes
- Understanding basic SQL queries (`SELECT`, `COUNT`, `GROUP BY`, `DISTINCT`).  
- Practicing data analysis on real-world healthcare datasets.  
- Preparing a project for GitHub portfolio.
