# Hospital Admission Analysis - SQL Project

## Project Overview
This is a beginner-level SQL project that demonstrates basic data analysis on a hospital admissions dataset. The project includes SQL queries to calculate total admissions, analyze gender distribution, and explore the type of admissions.

## Features / Queries
- **Total Admissions**: Counts the total number of patient admissions.
- **Gender Distribution**: Shows the number of male and female patients.
- **Type of Admission**: Displays different admission types (e.g., Emergency, OPD).

## Dataset
- The project uses a synthetic hospital admissions dataset.
- The dataset contains basic patient information including `MRD_NO`, `Date_of_Admission`, `Date_of_Discharge`, `Age`, `Gender`, and `Type_of_Admission`.

## How to Use
1. Open your SQL environment (e.g., SQL Server Management Studio, MySQL Workbench).  
2. Create a new database and tables (or use the provided SQL scripts).  
3. Run the SQL scripts in order to generate reports and insights.  

## Learning Outcomes
- Understanding basic SQL queries (`SELECT`, `COUNT`, `GROUP BY`, `DISTINCT`).  
- Practicing data analysis on real-world healthcare datasets.  
- Preparing a basic project for GitHub portfolio as a fresher.
